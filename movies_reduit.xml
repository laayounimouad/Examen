        <fullplot>Following through on a promise to his mother, William Canning Jr. goes to River
            Junction to meet his father who has not seen him since he was a child. The younger
            Canning isn't quite what the elder was expecting but the old man has bigger problems.
            He's being put out of business by J.J. King, who not only owns the local hotel and bank,
            but has recently introduced a new paddle wheel steamer that puts Cannings older boat,
            the Stonewall Jackson, to shame. Bill Jr. and Kitty King take a liking to each other
            much to the dismay of both of their fathers. When a fierce storm hits River Junction,
            Bill Jr. is forced to save Kitty, her father and his father.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Mickey is piloting a steamboat when Captain Pete comes to the bridge and throws
            him off. They stop to pick up cargo. Minnie just misses the boat and Mickey uses the
            crane to grab her. She drops her sheet music of "Turkey in the Straw" and a goat eats
            it. With help from Mickey, she cranks the goat's tail, and it plays the tune. Mickey
            accompanies on percussion and by torturing various animals, until Pete comes down and
            puts a stop to it, putting Mickey to work peeling potatoes. While this is the first
            sound Mickey Mouse, there's no dialog.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Innocent and naive Letty Mason moves from her Virginia home to Sweet Water on the
            western prairies to live on the ranch of her cousin Beverly, his wife Cora and their
            three children. Letty quickly learns how inhospitable the environment in Sweet Water is,
            the most obvious item being the incessant wind. But equally inhospitable are the
            unrefined way the people in Sweet Water live to which she is unaccustomed, and Cora, who
            believes Letty has come to steal Beverly away from her. As such, Cora orders Letty out
            of her and Bev's house. With no money, Letty is forced to accept one of the marriage
            proposal she receives, the lesser evil being that from Bev and Cora's ranching neighbor,
            Lige Hightower, a man who she does not love. Despite a less than harmonious start,
            Letty, in part due to her isolation as she is more often than not forced to stay inside
            due to the wind, begins to have affection for Lige, who wants to do right by her, and
            who promises to send her back to Virginia when he is financial able. But a visitor who
            takes refuge in their house away from the wind may threaten Letty's ultimate
            happiness.</fullplot>

            <consensus>The Broadway Melody is interesting as an example of an early Hollywood
                musical, but otherwise, it's essentially bereft of appeal for modern
                audiences.</consensus>

        <fullplot>Biopic of the famed British Prime Minister focusing on his concern about Russia's
            growing interest in the Indian subcontinent and his attempts to buy the Suez Canal. He
            sees the Canal as the key strategic resource in maintaining the Empire in the East but
            is unpopular in many quarters. With antisemitism rife at the time, Disraeli finds little
            support for his plan to purchase the canal or his foreign policy in general. There is no
            doubt that the Russians are plotting against British interests and he is surrounded by
            spies, even in his office at 10 Downing St. When the Bank of England refuses to finance
            the purchase of the available shares he turns to private sources to raise the available
            cash only to find the conspirators one step ahead of him.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>A partly fictionalized account of history begins with the arrival of slatternly
            Emma Hart, a cook's daughter, at the home of Charles Greville. Greville takes her as his
            lover and grooms her until their relationship becomes an inconvenience. Greville then
            dupes Emma into traveling to Naples to live with his uncle, Lord Hamilton, ambassador to
            the court at Naples. Realizing that Greville has abandoned her, Emma agrees to marry
            Lord Hamilton. Soon, however, she meets Admiral Horatio Nelson of the British Navy. Emma
            plays a crucial role in convincing Naples to open its ports to Nelson during his
            campaign against Napoleon's French fleet. Soon, Emma and the married Nelson become
            romantically involved -- a relationship which will have consequences for them
            both.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Army Sergeant Mickey Dunn sets out in pursuit of the Cisco Kid, a notorious if
            kind-hearted and charismatic bandit of the Old West. The Kid spends much of his loot on
            Tonia, the woman he loves, not realizing that she is being unfaithful to him in his
            absence. Soon, with her oblivious paramour off plying his trade, Tonia falls in with
            Dunn, drawn by the allure of a substantial reward for the Kid's capture -- dead or
            alive. Together, they concoct a plan to ambush and do away with the Cisco Kid once and
            for all.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>This is an English language film (made in America) adapted from a novel by German
            author Erich Maria Remarque. The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into
            enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told
            entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy
            of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all
            around them, any preconceptions about "the enemy" and the "rights and wrongs" of the
            conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene
            where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save
            his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism
            but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the
            actuality.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Jerry and Ted are young, in love, and part of the New York 'in-crowd'. Jerry's
            decision to marry Ted crushes a yearning Paul. Distraught Paul gets drunk and wrecks his

            on both sides. Inwardly unhappy, popular Jerry lives a party life while Ted sinks into a
            life of alcoholism. Jerry then runs into Paul, who still loves her. After spending time
            together with Jerry, Paul plans to divorce Dorothy. When Jerry sees Dorothy again, she
            has second thoughts about where her life is heading.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Aboard the U.S. submarine S13 in the China seas, Chief Torpedoman Burke goes about
            his duties. In actuality, he is Quartermaine, the infamous former commander of the
            British ship Royal Scot, which was sunk by Germans with a Field Marshal aboard.
            Quartermaine had told his sweetheart that the Field Marshal would be aboard, not knowing
            that she was an informant for the enemy. When the S13 sinks, Burke takes charge when the
            commander, Ensign Price, is unable to command. Burke must keep his mates alive long
            enough on the bottom of the sea for rescuers to arrive.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>A group of German infantrymen of the First World War live out their lives in the
            trenches of France. They find brief entertainment and relief in a village behind the
            lines, but primarily terror fills their lives as the attacks on and from the French army
            ebb and flow. One of the men, Karl, goes home on leave only to discover the degradation
            forced on his family by wartime poverty. He returns to the lines in time to face an
            enormous attack by French tanks.</fullplot>

            and the Kulack class was liquidated, "Earth" was viewed negatively by many Soviets

        <fullplot>Wisbourg, Germany based estate agent Knock dispatches his associate, Hutter, to
            Count Orlok's castle in Transylvania as the Count wants to purchase an isolated house in
            Wisbourg. They plan on selling him the one across the way from Hutter's own home. Hutter
            leaves his innocent wife, Ellen, with some friends while he is away. Hutter's trek is an
            unusual one, with many locals not wanting to take him near the castle where strange
            events have been occurring. Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count the
            house, but he also notices and feels unusual occurrences, primarily feeling like there
            is a dark shadow hanging over him, even in the daytime when the Count is unusually
            asleep. Hutter eventually sees the Count's sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a
            book he has recently read, believes the Count is really a vampire or Nosferatu. While
            Hutter is trapped in the castle, the Count, hiding in a shipment of coffins, makes his
            way to Wisbourg, causing death along his way, which most attribute to the plague. Hutter
            himself tries to rush home to save his town and most importantly save Ellen from
            Nosferatu's imminent arrival. In Wisbourg, Ellen can feel the impending darkness as
            Nosferatu gets closer. But she learns that a sinless woman can sacrifice herself to kill
            the vampire. Will Hutter be able to save Ellen either from Nosferatu and/or her
            self-sacrifice?</fullplot>

            Purcell, despite his frequent binges, his frequent gambling and their squalid living

            gambling, he gives it to Dink and they race it at a Tijuana track. There, Dink meets
            Linda Carleton, a race horse owner herself, and they have an immediate rapport. But
            Linda's rich husband sees Andy and realizes Dink is Linda's son, who she gave up when
            she and Andy divorced. Andy is bribed $200 to allow Dink to visit with Linda, but
            refuses to allow Dink to spend six months with the Carletons. When Andy loses the horse
            gambling and winds up in jail after a drunken tirade, he realizes Dink's place is with
            his mother. Dink tearfully goes but sneaks out and returns at his first opportunity,
            filling a depressed Andy with a desire to make good. So Andy goes into training after
            his managers arrange a boxing match with the Mexican champion.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>When the government opens up the Oklahoma territory for settlement, restless
            Yancey Cravat claims a plot of the free land for himself and moves his family there from
            Wichita. A newspaperman, lawyer, and just about everything else, Cravat soon becomes a
            leading citizen of the boom town of Osage. Once the town is established, however, he
            begins to feel confined once again, and heads for the Cherokee Strip, leaving his family
            behind. During this and other absences, his wife Sabra must learn to take care of
            herself and soon becomes prominent in her own right.</fullplot>

            <consensus>Cimarron is supported by a strong performance from Irene Dunne, but uneven in
                basically every other regard, and riddled with potentially offensive
                stereotypes.</consensus>

        <fullplot>After a harrowing ride through the Carpathian mountains in eastern Europe,
            Renfield enters castle Dracula to finalize the transferral of Carfax Abbey in London to
            Count Dracula, who is in actuality a vampire. Renfield is drugged by the eerily hypnotic
            count, and turned into one of his thralls, protecting him during his sea voyage to
            London. After sucking the blood and turning the young Lucy Weston into a vampire,
            Dracula turns his attention to her friend Mina Seward, daughter of Dr. Seward who then
            calls in a specialist, Dr. Van Helsing, to diagnose the sudden deterioration of Mina's
            health. Van Helsing, realizing that Dracula is indeed a vampire, tries to prepare Mina's
            fiance, John Harker, and Dr. Seward for what is to come and the measures that will have
            to be taken to prevent Mina from becoming one of the undead.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>A Vienna based acting couple make magic when they perform together on stage.
            Unknown to the theater going public and despite being married for only six months, that
            magic seems no longer to translate to their personal life, where they are constantly
            arguing, even under their breaths during on-stage curtain calls. These arguments stem
            from the actress' moody behavior, which the actor believes means that she no longer
            loves him and that she is looking for another man to replace him in her personal life.
            He believes she even scans the audience for potential suitors, probably being most
            attracted to the soldier type. Their feuding is at a point where they take pot shots at
            each other about everything in their lives, even the quality of the other's acting. The
            actor may have a valid point as the actress has been receiving bouquets of roses of late
            and a Russian guardsman has been seen hanging around outside their home. The actor knows
            these things as he is that Russian guardsman (who is also a Russian prince) in disguise,
            he who is also sending the flowers as the guardsman. He wants to see if this guardsman
            can indeed woo his wife away from him, and thus show her for who she really is. He
            concocts a further scheme to pretend to be out of town for a 24 hour period on another
            acting engagement, during which time he will try and seduce her as the guardsman. But
            the actress may throw some wrenches into his plan.</fullplot>

            to New York for a higher paying advertising job. The court press room is full of lame
            reporters who invent stories as much as write them. All are waiting to cover the hanging
            of Earl Williams. When Williams escapes from the inept Sheriff, Hildy seizes the
            opportunity by using his $260 honeymoon money to payoff an insider and get the scoop on
            the escape. However, Walter Burns, the Post's editor, is slow to repay Hildy back,
            hoping that he will stay on the story. Getting a major scoop looks possible when Hildy
            stumbles onto the bewildered escapee and hides him in a roll-top desk in the press room.
            Burns shows up to help. Can they keep Williams' whereabouts secret long enough to get
            the scoop, especially with the Sheriff and other reporters hovering around?</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Tom Powers and Matt Doyle are best friends and fellow gangsters, their lives
            frowned upon by Tom's straight laced brother, Mike, and Matt's straight laced sister,
            Molly. From their teen-aged years into young adulthood, Tom and Matt have an
            increasingly lucrative life, bootlegging during the Prohibition era. But Tom in
            particular becomes more and more brazen in what he is willing to do, and becomes more
            obstinate and violent against those who either disagree with him or cross him. When one
            of their colleagues dies in a freak accident, a rival bootlegging faction senses
            weakness among Tom and Matt's gang, which is led by Paddy Ryan. A gang war ensues,
            resulting in Paddy suggesting that Tom and Matt lay low. But because of Tom's basic
            nature, he decides instead to take matters into his own hands.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Precocious adolescent Skippy Skinner spends most of his time trying to get around
            doing those things that his parents want him to do (like brush his teeth), while doing
            those things his parents don't want him to do. Chief among the latter is spending time
            across the railroad tracks in Shantytown, instead of playing with "clean" neighborhood
            kids like brother and sister Sidney and Eloise. Skippy's father, Dr. Herbert Skinner,
            the city's head of the health board, in particular doesn't like Skippy spending time
            there as Dr. Skinner is a verminophobe, and believes Shantytown is dirty and unhealthy.
            On Skippy's latest visit to Shantytown when he meets a new friend named Sooky Wayne, he
            learns that Shantytown is being torn down and its poor residents have to move. And
            Sooky's mongrel and unlicensed (since Mrs. Wayne can't afford the $3 license fee) dog
            Penny is captured by the city's dog catcher. As Skippy does whatever he can to raise the
            $3 to get Penny back for his new friend (which includes breaking into his piggy bank,
            holding a variety show for the Shantytown kids, and trying to ask his father for the
            money), Skippy learns that one person seems to be responsible for both these problems in
            his life, which makes the already tenuous relationship with this person even more
            tenuous.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>A famous left-wing satirical comedy about two ex-convicts, one of whom escaped
            jail and then worked his way up from salesman to factory owner, where he oversees a
            highly mechanized operation where the workers are reduced to mere automatons. Fearful of
            being exposed over his past, at first by his friend and later by another gangster, the
            owner chooses to give his factory to the workers, then escapes with his friend to the
            freedom of the open road. The production company for "A Nous la Liberte" was for more
            than a decade embroiled in a lawsuit claiming that Charles Chaplin had seen their film
            and plagiarized many ideas from it as he developed "Modern Times."</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Having returned from fighting in World War I, James Allen doesn't want to settle
            into a humdrum life and decides to set off to find his fortune. He travels the length
            and breadth of America, working as a skilled tradesman in the construction industry.
            When times get tough however, he finds himself living in a shelter where an acquaintance
            suggests they go out for a hamburger. What the friend really has in mind is to rob the
            diner and Allen soon finds himself working on a chain gang with a long jail sentence.
            Allen manages to escape however and heads to Chicago where over several years he slowly
            but surely works his way up the ladder to become one of the most respected construction
            engineers in the city. His past catches up with him and despite protestations from civic
            leaders and his many friends in Chicago, he finds himself again on the chain gang.
            Escaping for a second time, he accepts that to survive, he must lead a life of
            crime.</fullplot>

            money by a viscount (Charles Ruggles). Stalling for time, the titled but penniless

        <fullplot>In 1921 a field expedition in Egypt discovers the mummy of ancient Egyptian prince
            Im-Ho-Tep, who was condemned and buried alive for sacrilege. Also found in the tomb is
            the Scroll of Thoth, which can bring the dead back to life. One night a young member of
            the expedition reads the Scroll out loud, and then goes insane, realizing that he has
            brought Im-Ho-Tep back to life. Ten years later, disguised as a modern Egyptian, the
            mummy attempts to reunite with his lost love, an ancient princess who has been
            reincarnated into a beautiful young woman.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>The Laurel &amp; Hardy Moving Co. have a challenging job on their hands (and
            backs): hauling a player piano up a monumental flight of stairs to Prof. von
            Schwarzenhoffen's house. Their task is complicated by a sassy nursemaid and, unbeknownst
            to them, the impatient Prof. von Schwarzenhoffen himself. But the biggest problem is the
            force of gravity, which repeatedly pulls the piano back down to the bottom of the
            stairs. Finally, the irate Professor explodes in fury to discover the "mechanical
            blunderbuss" in his home, not knowing it was a surprise birthday present from his
            wife.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Johnny Lovo rises to the head of the bootlegging crime syndicate on the south side
            of Chicago following the murder of former head, Big Louis Costillo. Johnny contracted
            Big Louis' bodyguard, Tony Camonte, to make the hit on his boss. Tony becomes Johnny's
            second in command. Johnny is not averse to killing anyone who gets in his and Johnny's
            way. As Tony is thinking bigger than Johnny and is not afraid of anyone or anything,
            Tony increasingly makes decisions on his own instead of following Johnny's orders,
            especially in not treading on the north side run by an Irish gang led by a man named
            O'Hara, of whom Johnny is afraid. Tony's murder spree increases, he taking out anyone
            who stands in his and Johnny's way of absolute control on the south side, and in Tony's
            view absolute control of the entire city. Tony's actions place an unspoken strain
            between Tony and Johnny to the point of the two knowing that they can't exist in their
            idealized world with the other. Tony's ultimate downfall may be one of two women in his
            life: Poppy, Johnny's girlfriend to who Tony is attracted; and Tony's eighteen year old
            sister, Cesca, who is self-professed to be older mentally than her years much to Tony's
            chagrin, he who will do anything to protect her innocence. Cesca ultimately comes to the
            realization that she is a lot more similar to her brother than she first
            imagined.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Many passengers on the Shanghai Express are more concerned that the notorious
            Shanghai Lil is on board than the fact that a civil war is going on that may make the
            trip take more than three days. The British Army doctor, Donald Harvey, knew Lil before
            she became a famous "coaster." A fellow passenger defines a coaster as "a woman who
            lives by her wits along the China coast." When Chinese guerillas stop the train, Dr.
            Harvey is selected as the hostage. Lil saves him, but can she make him believe that she
            really hasn't changed from the woman he loved five years before?</fullplot>

            making a fool of himself to please his boss, who's son is an outwitted member of the
            boys' gang. The brothers' revolt claiming that hierarchy should be based on ability, not
            on social background. Ozu's charming film is a social satire that draws from the antics
            of childhood as well as the tragedy of maturity.</fullplot>

        <fullplot>Mala leads a contented life as the best hunter in his Canadian Arctic tribe,
            providing meat, fish and birds with his great skill. When another tribe member returns
            from trading furs with the white men for items such as a gun and an iron needle, Mala's
            wife, Aba, urges him to make the 500-mile trek across the frozen tundra to do the same.
            After the long night of winter, Mala does go with his family to the white man's
            "floating house" in Tjarnak. The friendly captain makes trade for Mala's excellent furs,
            but upsets Mala when he insists that Aba sleep with him that night. "He didn't even ask
            me!" Mala complains. Afterwards, the captain suggests that Mala go whale hunting and
            promises not to touch his wife, so Mala agrees. But news of a successful catch spurs a
            celebration on board ship, and the captain has Aba forcibly removed from her tent, plied
            with liquor, and then he rapes her. In the morning, the still-drunk Aba staggers from
            the ship, but collapses in the snow, where she is mistaken for an animal by a hunter and
            shot and killed. When Mala returns from the whaling expedition, he learns that Aba "has
            swallowed sleep." He is so enraged he harpoons the captain, packs up his dog sled team
            and leaves with the rest of his family. It takes some time to recover from his grief and
            take on two new wives including Iva, who has loved him all along. The newly formed Royal
            Canadian Mounted Police learns of the murder and dispatches two mounties to arrest Mala.
            Ironically, Mala finds them frozen in the snow, near death, and saves their lives
            reluctantly, since he now trusts no white man. But they convince him they are his
            friends and must go back with them or else they may starve. So he goes, leaving his
            family behind. At the RCMP base, Mala learns from a translator he may hang. With great
            effort, he slips out of his shackled wrist, injuring his hand, steals food and a dog
            sled team and heads back to his land. In the morning, the two mounties go after
            him.</fullplot>

            leaving to become a railway porter. Jones joins the congregation in a spiritual. Once on
            the train, Jeff, a porter, shows Jones the ropes. Jones secretly takes up with Jeff's

        <fullplot>Chorus girls Polly, Carol and Trixie are ecstatic when they learn that Broadway
            producer Barney Hopkins is putting on a new show. He promises all of the girls parts in
            the new show and even hires their neighbor Brad Roberts, an unknown composer, to write
            some of the music. There's only one problem: he doesn't have the money to bankroll it
            all. That problem is solved when Brad turns out to be quite rich but he insists that he
            not perform. When opening night comes, the juvenile lead can't go on forcing Brad to
            take the stage. He's recognized of course and his upper crust family wants him to quit.
            When he refuses, they tell him to end his relationship with Polly or face having his
            income cut off. When Brad's snobbish brother Lawrence mistakes Carol for Polly, the
            girls decide to have a bit of fun and teach him a lesson.</fullplot>

            latitude to conduct some of his own experiments. His sudden departure, however, has
            Cranley's daughter Flora worried about him. Griffin has taken a room at the nearby
            Lion's Head Inn, hoping to reverse an experiment he conducted on himself that made him
            invisible. Unfortunately, the drug he used has also warped his mind, making him
            aggressive and dangerous. He's prepared to do whatever it takes to restore his
            appearance, and several will die in the process.</fullplot>

            Desert" lodge convention, Ollie pretends to be sick, and gets a doctor (who turns out to

            the brick house. But when the wolf comes around and blows their houses down (after
            trickery like dressing as a foundling sheep fails), they run to their brother's house.
            And throughout, they sing the classic song, "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad
            Wolf?".</fullplot>
